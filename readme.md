password_manager
---
I'm going to building a password manager using tkinter.

It's going to be called MyPass, password manager, and it could be use ti store and generate passwords.
For example, if you wanted to craete an account on App X, you enter the name of the website, put your email or username. 
And then all you have to do is to either come up with a password, that is hopefully not terrible, but you can obviously 
never remember, or you can use the builtin generate password to just generate a very complex, very long password with 
all the required numbers and symbols and all of that. 

And once I'm done with that, then I can click add, and I get a popup 
asking me if this is okay.
And if that all looks good, then I click Yes and that data gets added to 
a text file, which you can have on your computer.
So this is not an internet-based service, and you keep everything 
locally on your computer, which some people feel is a lot safer than using a 
third-party service like LastPass or whatever else. 

It's got some really neat features. For example, it's got some basic validations. So if you, for example leave one of 
the filed empty, and you click add, get a popup that tells you, please don't leave any of the fields empty. Or if you 
generate a password, then you can actually immediately use it by pasting it.
